    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi everyone, pretty much everyone knows that young people and older people handle things very differently.  This is seen across almost every sector but is very noticeable in banking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This capstone projects analyze banking data to see how banking preferences change by age group over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: How has banking preferences changed by age group over time?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agile**\n",
    "I used the Agile / Scrum Framework to guide me through this project by being put in a group to help progres in the Savvy Coders Curriculum and this project.  We created two week sprints that included backlog items for this capstone, learning requirements, homework, and more using Jira to manage our progress.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each week, Monday through Thursday, I met with my team and performed daily stand ups in which we discussed updates, what we did yesterday, what we will do today, and if there are any roadblocks in regards to our capstone project and learning in general.  These daily standups allowed us time to update the Jira Boards by completing any tasks and child issues and adding anything we could not get too to our backlog. \n",
    "\n",
    "After completing two week sprints, our team would conduct a review and retrospective in whch we would get feedback on what went well, what didn't go well, and how you could improve.  This was mainly a discussion with the instructors at Savvy Coders and how the training could have been improved, and what we enjoyed.  We would also complete the sprint and plan out the next sprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "This kept our learning on pace and gave us a space to discuss any problems we may have and what we are working on together.  This gave me an interesting look into what it would be like to work in an Agile Team. \n",

    "**User Story**\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition Statement: I want to build a data analysis project that answers the following question about banking preferences: How has banking preferences changed by age group over time? \n",
    "\n",
    "Definition of Audience: The type of peope that would be interested in this analysis would be marketers at a bank trying to tailor their marketing/advertising to a certain age group based on how they would use their account. Executives at banks could use this data to see how they could tailor their products or offers to a certain age group.  \n",
